# hello-world

Hi there,

I'm learning to use Github to manage my own projects and related materials.
I enjoyed this learning processing.

I've learnt to create an open source repository, start and manageed a new branch, change a file and committed changes to github, open and merge a pull request.

I'm learning to create an issue and link a pull request to an issue.
